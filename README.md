**Market Basket Analysis for E-commerce in Python**

This repository contains Python code and documentation for performing Market Basket Analysis (MBA) on an e-commerce dataset. 
Market Basket Analysis is a technique used to uncover associations between items purchased together by customers.

**Overview**

Market Basket Analysis is a crucial method in understanding customer purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to derive insights for product placement, promotions, and recommendations. This project explores the association rules among items bought by customers in an e-commerce setting.

**Features**

Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
Conducts data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Market Basket Analysis techniques.
Provides visualizations and interpretation of association rules and itemsets.
Offers recommendations based on insights derived from the analysis.

**Contents**

Code: Jupyter Notebook developed in Google Colab, containing the entire analysis process step-by-step.
Documentation: Includes a README.md file explaining the project, its objectives, and how to navigate through the code and analysis.
Datasets: Any relevant datasets used for analysis (if allowed for distribution).
Presentation: Slides or a report summarizing key findings, insights, and recommendations.

**Usage**

The provided Jupyter Notebook guides through the analysis process. The code demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, Market Basket Analysis using Apriori algorithm, and visualizations.

**How to Run**
Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environment.
